# Junction 2025 – Fortum Forecasting Challenge  
### Electricity Consumption Forecasting (48-Hour & 12-Month Horizons)

This repository contains my full solution for the Fortum challenge at Junction 2025.  
The goal is to forecast electricity consumption for 112 customer groups at two horizons:

- **48-hour short-term forecast** (hourly resolution)
- **12-month long-term forecast** (monthly resolution)

The forecasts are generated using **Prophet** models trained independently on each customer group.

All code, data processing, forecasting, evaluation, and exports required by the challenge
are included here.
